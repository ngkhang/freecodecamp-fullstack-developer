/*
Build the Largest Number Finder

In this lab, you will build a function that returns an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for `loop`, and access each member with array syntax `arr[i]`.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

    1. You should create a function `largestOfAll` that takes an array of arrays as an argument.
    2. The function should return an array containing the largest number from each sub-array.
*/
const largestOfAll = (arr) => {
	const largestNumbers = [];
	arr.forEach((subArr) => {
		largestNumbers.push(Math.max(...subArr));
	});
	return largestNumbers;
};
