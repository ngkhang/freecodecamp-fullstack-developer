Build a Record Collection

You are creating a function that aids in the maintenance of a musical album collection. The collection is organized as an object that contains multiple albums which are also objects. Each album is represented in the collection with a unique `id` as the property name. Within each album object, there are various properties describing information about the album. Not all albums have complete information.

The `updateRecords` function takes 4 arguments represented by the following function parameters:
    - `records` - an object containing several individual albums
    - `id` - a number representing a specific album in the `records` object
    - `prop` - a string representing the name of the album’s property to update
    - `value` - a string containing the information used to update the album’s property

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

    1. Your function must always return the entire `records` object.
    2. If `value` is an empty string, delete the given `prop` property from the album.
    3.  If `prop` isn't `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, assign the `value` to that album's `prop`.
    4. If `prop` is `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, but the album doesn't have a `tracks` property, create an empty array and add `value` to it.
    5. If prop is `tracks` and `value` isn't an empty string, add `value` to the end of the album's existing `tracks` array.

Note: A copy of the `recordCollection` object is used for the tests. Your function should not directly refer to the `recordCollection` object, only the function parameter.
