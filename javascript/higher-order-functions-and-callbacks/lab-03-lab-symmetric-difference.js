/*
Build a Symmetric Difference Function

Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

Example:
    - Array A: ["diamond", "stick", "apple"]
    - Array B: ["stick", "emerald", "bread"]

Result: ["diamond", "apple", "emerald", "bread"]

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

    1. Your function `diffArray` should return an array.
    2. Your function should take two arguments, both of which are arrays.
    3. Your function should make use of the `filter` method.
    4. Your function should return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.
    5. Your function should return an empty array if there is no symmetric difference.

const diffArray = (arrA, arrB) => {
	const itemsNotIncludeInArrB = arrA.filter((item) => !arrB.includes(item));
	const itemsNotIncludeInArrA = arrB.filter((item) => !arrA.includes(item));

	return [...itemsNotIncludeInArrB, ...itemsNotIncludeInArrA];
};
