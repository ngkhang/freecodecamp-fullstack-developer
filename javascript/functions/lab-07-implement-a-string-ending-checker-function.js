/*
Build a Confirm the Ending Tool

In this lab, you will implement a function that checks if a string ends with the given target string.

Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

User Stories:

    1. You should create a function named `confirmEnding` that takes two parameters: the string to check and the string to check against.
    2. The function should return `true` if the first string ends with the second string, and `false` otherwise.
    3. You should not use the `.endsWith()` method; instead, use one of the JavaScript substring methods to achieve this.
*/
function confirmEnding(str, target) {
	const subStr = str.slice(-target.length);

	return subStr === target;
}
